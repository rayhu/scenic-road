# Scenic Road App Requirements

## Overview

The Scenic Road app is designed to provide users with an interactive experience by displaying nearby landmarks on a map and offering information and navigation options. The app will utilize location services, OpenAI API, and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities to enhance user engagement.

## Core Requirements

1. **Location Services**
   - On app launch, check if location permissions are granted.
   - If not granted, request location permissions from the user.
   - Once permissions are granted, obtain the user's current location.

2. **Map Display**
   - Display a map centered on the user's current location.
   - Use a mapping library (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) to render the map.

3. **Landmark Retrieval**
   - Call the OpenAI API to retrieve a list of landmarks around the user's coordinates.
   - Display these landmarks as markers on the map.

4. **Landmark List View**
   - Provide a list view of the landmarks with their respective distances from the user's location.

5. **Landmark Interaction**
   - Tapping on a landmark marker should present two options:
     1. **Introduction**: 
        - Call the OpenAI API to generate a short introduction about the landmark.
        - Use TTS to read the introduction aloud to the user.
     2. **Navigation**:
        - Open the platform's navigation app to provide directions to the landmark.

## Additional Requirements

1. **User Interface**
   - Design a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate.
   - Ensure the app is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling for API calls and location services.
   - Provide user feedback in case of errors (e.g., unable to retrieve location or landmarks).

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize the app for performance to ensure smooth operation.
   - Minimize API calls and manage resources efficiently.

4. **Security**
   - Ensure that sensitive data, such as API keys, are securely stored and not exposed in the app.

5. **Testing**
   - Conduct thorough testing on both Android and iOS platforms.
   - Test for various scenarios, including denied location permissions and API failures.

## Future Enhancements

- Add user preferences for filtering landmarks by type or distance.
- Implement offline mode for map and landmark data.
- Integrate social sharing features for users to share their experiences.

## Conclusion

The Scenic Road app aims to provide an engaging and informative experience for users by leveraging location services, AI-generated content, and interactive maps. By following these requirements, the app will offer a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
